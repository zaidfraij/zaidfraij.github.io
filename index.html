        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      
        
<p>The summer of finding myself. The summer of not knowing where i'm heading.The summer right before starting my first semester in University.This summer was worth writing about becaue i've learned alot of new things about myself.From <em>hobbies</em> to <em>learing new skills</em> to even <em>leading a new mindset</em>. <strong>I,d like to come back to this blog to see how much I improved and to look back at where it all started</strong></p>
        
        
        <h2 id="fam"> Family time</h2>
        
        
<p>After Spending my first long year in Germany, i've missed my Family. <strong>The first thing I wanted to do in my Summer, was go to Jordan to see my Family</strong> , so I did.I had just finished My FSP exam, <em>Which declares if i can enter a german university or not, </em> and even though i know i did very well, i was still a bit nervous.Anyways seeing my family in jordan refreshed my motivation and gave me back my energy.We even went to palestine, My home country, and that was just wonderful.I didn't get enough of my family though, because i had to go back early to finish my application for the university that im willing to attend.</p>
        
         
         <h2 id="programming-skills"> New Programming Skills</h2>
         
         
<p><strong>I find that Technology has taken over the world.I also think that there is more and more to come</strong>.Thats why i want to study Computer engineering at the University of Paderborn. Im growing more interest by the day for technology.But it came to my realisation, that i dont know Anything about Computers, or how they work. I basically dont have any important computer skill till now. Thats why I set a goal this summer to learn more about programming.<br>As i started searching for courses online, i found Khan academy. Thats where i started learning progrsmming. Even though I am taking baby steps, i'm still glad that i'm learning a new relevant skill.I started off by leaning JavaScript. Even though i was learning fast and not finding any problems.I kept on forgetting what i was learning. That is because I didn't practice enough. I then decided to start learning HTML and CSS and go back to JS later. But I'm Trying to avoid doing the same mistake that I did with JS. </p>


<h2 id="job-search"> The disappointing search of a job</h2>


<p><strong>One of the many things i wanted to this summer is find a job.</strong>
<br> I wanted a job for the follwing reasons:<br>
<ul>
    <li> To learn new skills</li>
    <li> To experience what its like to have a job
    <li> To improve my german language</li>
    <li> To meet new people </li>
    <li> To earn money for my Online business idea (next chapter)
</ul>
 
 I set out options and jobs that I wanted to go for this summer, and i prioritised them. So if i didnt make a job, i'd try out for the next best option.<br> My first option was a to work for a <strong>well known computer company</strong>, even though i had no experience, i hoped that they will take me for my motivation and my eagerness for learning.I was willing to work for free. The first company that i went to was Fraunhoffer, but the told me that they dont have a place that suits my position, keeping in my mind that I'm still not even a studen at the uni. But atleast i got new contacts there, and they liked my motivation, they told me i should try sendning an application when i start my uni. As i searched other computer companies' websites, they all had no options that i could go for. So I just went for my secon option<br>
 <strong>Retail stores and gyms</strong> were my second options. I sent out applications but guess what, those didnt work out too. I think it was also because of my current status (not officially enrolled in a uni).<br>
 My third option was working in <strong>production</strong>. So I went to a couple of offices, that Help people finding production jobs. One of them said they'll look for a job and call back (they did'nt). The other one told me that i can't work because of something in my german identity card.<br>
 This led me to going to the Studienkolleg ( the place where i attended my foundation year) so that they would explain to me what the problem was.The did not only ask about the problem and fix it. But they also Recommended me to dSPACE, a really big well known computer company. So i sent my documents to them and i'm waiting and hoping for the best. They also offered to look for other people they could recommend me to in other big companies like Diebold Nixdorf and Atos.</p>
    
    <h2 id="business-ideas"> Business Ideas</h2>
    
    <p><strong>While I was looking for a job, I was also looking for business ideas that i could implement before and/or during my upcoming university years.</strong><br>
I thought of stuff like cleaning windows and washing cars. But since i'm in germany, if i want to work such a thing I need to pay taxes, and I can't do that because i have a student visa, and im not allowed to work alone.So i started looking for things online.<br>I learned about trading, but didn't quite see my self trading. So i searched simpler things, like upwork.com where i help people online with tasks they don't want to do.But that wasn't it.<br>
Then I found something that caught my attention. <em id="dropshipping">Dropshipping</em>.<br>
Yeah, I know Shopify has been a thing for a while now, but i didnt know about it. But the idea of openning a Website, selling stuff that i dont have to store, with such a non-expensive startup seemed like a great way of learning stuff about business without taking a big risk. Therefor I studied all the stuff I needed about dropshipping and shopify. I was hoping to find a job while i was learning those new schools, so that i would be able to cover costs like marketing and the monthly subscribtion. To sum it up There are three steps to starting an online Shopify store. </p>

<h3>1. Finding the Right product to Sell.</h3>

    <p>Even though I haven't found the right product to sell, I enjoy searching for products to sell. Sometimes i might think That this certain product or Niche would be perfect for me to sell, then i would wake up tomorrow and realise that its not. But I know I will find something</p>
    
<h3>2. Building up The Webpage.</h3>    

<p>I find this to be the easiest step. Shopify really helps with this step. Plus i've learned  on youtube the exact steps to creating an online shopify store and the additional things that will help my Store be successful</p>
    
<h3>3. Marketing</h3>

<p>The tricky step. This determines if you make it or you don't. Even though I still haven't picked up on a product yet, I have been learning more and more about Facebook marketing, which is the best way to market a product in modern day. I think this would be an important skill to learn, even if you aren't thinking about opening a store. Right after i'm willing to learn how to ctreate an appealing ad, with which i can seduce costumers.</p>


 <h2 id="sports"> Sports</h2>

<p>I've been into sports ever since i've been a kid.But this summer I filled most of my days with sports. I bought a bicycle this summer. <strong>cycling</strong> in Germany is a dream come true. Wandering around, losing my self in forests, riding to the Padersee while listening to podcosts, all this helps me stay motivated and inspired.Everyday I would ride that bicycle atleast for an hour.
<br>I also had time to try out a <strong>new workout plan </strong> at the gym, and that helped me improve my strength and the way my body looks. My new plan was working out 2 muscles a day, 6 days a week. This way i would work out each muscle group twice a week.<br> I also went <strong>climing</strong> but not so often, even though i enjoyed it alot. But most importantly, I have found a hobby tha t i'm most passionate about,<strong>Beach volleyball</strong>. Even though I have been playing volleyball for sometime now, I have tremendous amount of fun playing beach volley.</p>
